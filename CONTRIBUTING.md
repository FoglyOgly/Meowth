# Contributing to Meowth
There's three main methods to contribute to Meowth: 
1. Feature Suggestions
2. Reporting Issues
3. Submitting Pull Requests.

## Feature Suggestions
Feedback on what you want to see in future versions is always welcome. You're able to submit a feature suggestion through the [Issues page](https://github.com/scragly/Meowth/issues), where it can be reviewed and discussed. 

Make sure to only submit a single feature request per Issue submission and provide as much detail about that feature as possible so the team can get a clear understanding of what you're thinking.

Before making a new submission, always double check a similar suggestion hasn't already been made. Try a few different search terms that might be similar to what you're asking about, and if you find it's in the list already, be sure to react with a üëç to show you support for it.

Feature Requests can't go against the spirit of the project by suggesting anything that might break Terms of Service of either Pokemon Go or it's associated accounts.

## Reporting Issues
Bug Reports are able to be submitted on the [Issues page](https://github.com/scragly/Meowth/issues).

Before making a new Issue, thoroughly check beforehand that it hasn't already been submitted. In the case it has, you can react with a üëç to show you're having the same problem, and if you have any additional details on the bug, submit a clearly outlined comment.

There should only be one problem being addressed per Issue, so if you have multiple problems, submit them as individual Issues. Don't comment on existing Issues about unrelated bugs. If the error isn't the same, even if the symptoms might be similar, avoid derailing the existing Issue and submit it separately. 

Please include the following with each Issue:
* Version of Meowth - you can get this by running `pip show meowth`.
* If you are self-hosting and using custom extensions, confirmation that the bug still occurs when those are disabled.
* If you're using the public bot, what server and channels are involved (preferably IDs).
* Screenshots of the issue if possible.
* If self-hosting, a full copy of the traceback output if any.

Try to reply to requests for more info in a timely manner also, as if we can't reproduce the bug, the Issue will likely be closed.

## Submitting Pull Requests
Anyone is able to contribute to the code by submitting [Pull Requests](https://github.com/scragly/Meowth/pulls) for fixes and features. 

All contributors are required to follow the [Coding Guidelines](Coding-Guidelines). These outline the required workflow setup and the standard of code style and quality that is expected before PR's will be accepted.

PR's can't go against the spirit of the project by adding anything that might break Terms of Service of either Pokemon Go or it's associated accounts.

The main repository will not merge any code without it being in a pull request.
