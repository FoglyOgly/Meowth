This is what I use to generate Google Maps links to give people directions to raids and spawns! Knowing what town everything is in is often good enough to narrow it down. One way to put it is, for each channel you just listed, I need a location specific enough that I'll know hich First Baptist Church people mean. This is important, so please enter it in just this way. For each channel, give me a location using only letters, no punctuation. So something like 'kansas city mo' or 'hull uk' without the quotes and separate your locations with a comma and single space."
